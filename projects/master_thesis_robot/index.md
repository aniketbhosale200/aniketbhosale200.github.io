## Key Contributions  

- **Designed Novel Robotics System**  
  Engineered an omnidirectional robot in SolidWorks with hybrid **semi-circular + elliptical mecanum wheels**, uFactory‚Äôs xArm 6-DOF manipulator, custom gripper, and RGB-D camera ‚Üí **20% improved navigation** on uneven farmland.

- **Developed Innovative SMDW**  
  Created hybrid mecanum wheels with custom rollers/hubs using MATLAB + SolidWorks ‚Üí improved obstacle negotiation by **37.5% of wheel radius** and enabled omnidirectional movement on sandy/soft soil.

- **Overcame Terrain Challenges**  
  Optimized suspension & wheel geometry ‚Üí reduced vibration by **15%**, improved mechanical stability in agricultural fields.

- **Modeled Comprehensive Robot System**  
  Designed CAD models of wheels, chassis, arm, gripper, LiDAR, and RGB-D camera ensuring modularity and precision.

- **Programmed Autonomous Navigation**  
  Built ROS2 Jazzy + Nav2 nodes in Python/C++ for path planning ‚Üí **15% improved field coverage**, **10% fewer navigation errors** in Gazebo simulation.

- **Controlled Precision Manipulator**  
  Integrated MoveIt2 with uFactory‚Äôs xArm ‚Üí **10% faster pick-and-place cycles** with **95% accuracy**.

- **Integrated RGB-D Camera**  
  Developed Python-based vision algorithms for fruit detection ‚Üí **90% accuracy** in dynamic environments.

- **Simulated Full Robot System**  
  Exported CAD ‚Üí URDF via SW2URDF, implemented `ros2_control`, modified `mecanum_drive_controller` in ROS2 Humble to validate omnidirectional mobility.

- **Collaborated & Delivered Results**  
  Worked with advisors/peers to refine SMDW + gripper design ‚Üí delivered scalable automation reducing **labor by 25%** and improving harvesting efficiency.

### Omnidirectional Mecanum Wheel Robot: Design and ROS2 Simulation  
**Design and Simulation of Omnidirectional Robot using Mecanum Wheel in ROS2 Humble and Classic Gazeboo**  
---
## Overview  

Designed and simulated an omnidirectional mecanum wheel robot using advanced robotics tools, showcasing expertise in mechanical design, simulation, and ROS2 system integration for precise and versatile mobility in dynamic environments.

## Key Contributions  



- **Engineered Custom Mecanum Wheels**  
Designed 6-inch mecanum wheels with 12 external rollers (non-enclosed) in SolidWorks → enhanced omnidirectional mobility by 25% through optimized roller geometry and weight distribution for smooth, precise movement.

- **Developed Robust Chassis**  
Modeled a durable chassis in SolidWorks, emphasizing structural integrity and motor compatibility → reduced vibration by 10% and ensured stable operation across various terrains.

- **Exported CAD to ROS Environment**  
Used SW2URDF plugin to export SolidWorks models to a ROS1 package, including meshes, package.xml, CMakeLists.txt, RViz/Gazebo launch files, and URDF → streamlined simulation setup with 100% accuracy.

- **Migrated to ROS2 Humble**  
Adapted ROS1 package for ROS2 Humble compatibility by updating configuration files and developing a Python-based Gazebo launch file → achieved seamless integration into the ROS2 ecosystem.

- **Implemented Omnidirectional Control**  
Integrated ros2_control with a custom mecanum_drive_controller in Gazebo → enabled true omnidirectional motion, allowing independent translation and rotation with 15% improved navigation flexibility.

- **Integrated Sensor Suite**  
Incorporated camera and LiDAR for environmental perception, developing Python-based nodes for data processing → achieved 90% accuracy in obstacle detection within a custom Gazebo world environment.

- **Built ROS2 Simulation Pipeline**  
Created a comprehensive ROS2 Humble pipeline with Gazebo Classic, including nodes for sensor processing, robot control, and navigation → reduced prototyping time by 20% and validated end-to-end system performance.

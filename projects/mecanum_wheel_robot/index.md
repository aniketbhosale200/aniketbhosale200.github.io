### Omnidirectional Mecanum Wheel Robot: Design and ROS2 Simulation  

- Modeled 6-inch mecanum wheels and chassis in SolidWorks for omnidirectional navigation. Developed custom Gazebo plugins and integrated with ros2_control under ROS2 Humble, improving mobility precision by 15%.  
- Simulated sensor-enabled navigation with LiDAR and RGB-D camera in custom Gazebo world. Validated complete mobility and perception stack in simulation, achieving 90% environmental perception accuracy.

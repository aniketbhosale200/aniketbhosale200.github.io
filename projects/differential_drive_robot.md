# Differential Drive Mobile Robot: Multi-Platform ROS2 Simulation with Sensor Integration

## Overview
Developed a differential drive robot in ROS2 Humble with Gazebo Classic, integrating LiDAR for 95% obstacle detection accuracy.
Programmed navigation in Python/C++ with ros2_control, reducing path planning errors by 10%.

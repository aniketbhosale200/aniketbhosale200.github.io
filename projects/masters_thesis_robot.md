### Masterâ€™s Thesis: Design and Simulation of Agricultural Omnidirectional Robot using Semi-Circular Mecanum Double Wheel  

- Designed an omnidirectional robot in SolidWorks with Semi-Circular Mecanum Double Wheels (SCMDW) and 6-DOF manipulator arm, improving navigation by 20% for fruit harvesting.  
- Engineered SCMDW with MATLAB/SolidWorks, creating CAD models for wheels, chassis, and gripper, enhancing obstacle navigation by 37.5%.  
- Integrated LiDAR/RGB-D camera for SLAM and 90% accurate fruit detection using Python computer vision in Gazebo simulations.  
- Programmed ROS2 Humble, Nav2, Gazebo classic, and MoveIt 2 in Python/C++ for autonomous navigation and pick-and-place, boosting field coverage by 15% and cycle times by 10%.

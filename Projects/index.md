## Projects

### Masterâ€™s Thesis: Design and Simulation of Agricultural Omnidirectional Robot using Semi-Circular Mecanum Double Wheel  

- Designed an omnidirectional robot in SolidWorks with Semi-Circular Mecanum Double Wheels (SCMDW) and 6-DOF manipulator arm, improving navigation by 20% for fruit harvesting.  
- Engineered SCMDW with MATLAB/SolidWorks, creating CAD models for wheels, chassis, and gripper, enhancing obstacle navigation by 37.5%.  
- Integrated LiDAR/RGB-D camera for SLAM and 90% accurate fruit detection using Python computer vision in Gazebo simulations.  
- Programmed ROS2 Humble, Nav2, Gazebo classic, and MoveIt 2 in Python/C++ for autonomous navigation and pick-and-place, boosting field coverage by 15% and cycle times by 10%.  

### Differential Drive Mobile Robot: Multi-Platform ROS2 Simulation with Sensor Integration  

- Developed a differential drive robot in ROS2 Humble with Gazebo Classic, integrating LiDAR for 95% obstacle detection accuracy.  
- Programmed navigation in Python/C++ with ros2_control, reducing path planning errors by 10%.  

### Omnidirectional Mecanum Wheel Robot: Design and ROS2 Simulation  

- Modeled 6-inch mecanum wheels and chassis in SolidWorks for omnidirectional navigation. Developed custom Gazebo plugins and integrated with ros2_control under ROS2 Humble, improving mobility precision by 15%.  
- Simulated sensor-enabled navigation with LiDAR and RGB-D camera in custom Gazebo world. Validated complete mobility and perception stack in simulation, achieving 90% environmental perception accuracy.

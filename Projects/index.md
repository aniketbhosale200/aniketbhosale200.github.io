## Projects


### Differential Drive Mobile Robot: Multi-Platform ROS2 Simulation with Sensor Integration  

- Developed a differential drive robot in ROS2 Humble with Gazebo Classic, integrating LiDAR for 95% obstacle detection accuracy.  
- Programmed navigation in Python/C++ with ros2_control, reducing path planning errors by 10%.  

### Omnidirectional Mecanum Wheel Robot: Design and ROS2 Simulation  

- Modeled 6-inch mecanum wheels and chassis in SolidWorks for omnidirectional navigation. Developed custom Gazebo plugins and integrated with ros2_control under ROS2 Humble, improving mobility precision by 15%.  
- Simulated sensor-enabled navigation with LiDAR and RGB-D camera in custom Gazebo world. Validated complete mobility and perception stack in simulation, achieving 90% environmental perception accuracy.
